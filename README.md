The main objective of this work is to replicate the model presented in "[A simple model for control of COVID-19 infections on an urban campus][article]" by Robert Brown. This article presents a modified SEIR model on COVID-19 transmission on an urban campus and is verified using data collected in Fall 2020. Specifically, by exctracting the data used for the suggested study, we will run the same SEIR model and generate figures 1 to 3 to verify the replicability of the article.
