The main objective of this work is to replicate the model presented in "[A simple model for control of COVID-19 infections on an urban campus][article]" by Robert Brown. This article presents a modified SEIR model on COVID-19 transmission on an urban campus and is verified using data collected in Fall 2020. Specifically, by exctracting the data used for the suggested study, we will run the same SEIR model and generate figures 1 to 3 to verify the replicability of the article.

R. Brown suggested a SEIR - susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered - models with 5 compartments;
▪	Susceptibles (S)
▪	Infectious and symptomatic I(t)
▪	Infectious and asymptomatic A(t)
▪	Recovered R(t)
▪	Quarantine Q(t)
Where susceptibles individuals belonging to the campus community S(t) become infectious and asymptomatic at infection rate β. Infection is transmitted to the susceptible population from infectious and symptomatic individuals I(t) or infectious and asymptomatic individuals A(t) from the campus. However, infection can also be acquired from an external individual, and is therefore represented as an exogenous input of rate E(tau). 

The infectious and symptomatic individuals moved to quarantine Q(t) at the rate fq, while infectious and asymptomatic individuals are placed in quarantine at rate ft when tested positive. Since it is assumed that the sensibility of the testing method is lower than 100%, to illustrate the fraction of A(t) that are placed in quarantine, s parameter will be used. Individuals recovered at a rate fr. All quarantined individuals will subsequently recover at the same fr rate as the the unidentified infectious and asymptomatic individuals.
